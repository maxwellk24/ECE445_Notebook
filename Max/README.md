This is the week by week log for Maxwell Kramer for ECE 445 in Spring 2024

# 01/26/2024

Met with Ben and agreed oon general idea and being group mates. Ben seems to have an idea he's passionate about so I'm inclined to go with that. No technical details from me yet to put here.

Since last week we've looked for and gotten a new teammate with Manas Tiwari. Currently, work is just for homework, project remains in brainstorming stage.

Discussed with machine shop and were suprisingly told our plans for a 3d-printed casing for our devices was the best route. Proposal document was submitted as well for our general idea.

Moved onto initial PCB work. I've been asked to focus on the power subsystem for now, with possible work in other subsystems after.

After some reserach and TA consultation we'll be going with a buck convertor over a linear regulator. This is due to heating concerns as the rocket launch may overheat the beacon device.

Since all other systems will run on 3.3V we will chose the adafruit LM3671 3.3V Buck Convertor for our devices.

Ben is working on UI and MCU while Manas works on Sensors and Communication.

Focusing this week on Design Document and Review assignments. We have had some workload issues with Manas. So far he has not shown much technical work ability. His involvement in the design doc has been low, with minimal written work despite the remaining time we have. Ben and I also have reviewed his work thus far and have some concerns about copy/paste or even AI tool usage for some work he has done. He has not been able to explain with much confidence the material he has done and does not seem to undertsand a lot of the subsystems he's been assigned, despite the few weeks he's had them.

We had a serious sit down with him to discuss these issues in a professional manner in accord with the team contract. He denied any practices that violated any guidlines. Ben and I have discussed privately that we will discuss this matter with the TA soon.

Mainly working on PCB design for orders next week. Design review went well though so we have confidence in our current work. My focus besides power will be hardware testing so until parts arrive can't do much. Currently working though getting the order put together. 

Digikey order to get the GPS units should go out this week.
