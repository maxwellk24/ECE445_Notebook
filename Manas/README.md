# Jan 17 : Submitted Idea – Elderly Fall Detection

I submitted my idea with some details on the Web Board. This idea is about detecting and notifying for elderly, consisting of a simple wearable device containing a range of LIDAR sensors, accelerometers etc. and integrate them with PCB and demonstrate data collection from sensors. Need some help from the TAs on how to approach building such a solution.
It seems to be better to prioritize looking for the right partners. Posted that I’m looking for groupmates on the web-board. 

# Jan 24/25 : Forming Group and Early Approval - Handheld Rocket Tracker Project

Exchanged messages with Max to join their idea “Handheld Rocket Tracking”. This handheld device will have a GPS + Magnetometer + transmitter/receiver. With the sensors, the handheld will be able to receive the location of the puck in rocket, relative to itself, as well as the user's heading. Some concerns on where I would fit into this project considering I have limited experience in this field, but hoping we can work it out. Project has early-approval - Team #16
