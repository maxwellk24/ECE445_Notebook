# Manas Notebook Entries – ECE 445 - Spring 2024

# Jan 17 : Submitted Idea – Elderly Fall Detection

I submitted my idea with some details on the Web Board. This idea is about detecting and notifying for elderly, consisting of a simple wearable device containing a range of LIDAR sensors, accelerometers etc. and integrate them with PCB and demonstrate data collection from sensors. Need some help from the TAs on how to approach building such a solution.
It seems to be better to prioritize looking for the right partners. Posted that I’m looking for groupmates on the web-board. 

# Jan 24/25 : Forming Group and Early Approval - Handheld Rocket Tracker Project

Exchanged messages with Max to join their idea “Handheld Rocket Tracking”. This handheld device will have a GPS + Magnetometer + transmitter/receiver. With the sensors, the handheld will be able to receive the location of the puck in rocket, relative to itself, as well as the user's heading. Some concerns on where I would fit into this project considering I have limited experience in this field, but hoping we can work it out. Project has early-approval - Team #16

# Feb 1 : Team Meet - Identify major parts of project and assignment

We met as a team and brainstormed the sub-systems we would need. Ben seems to be the most knowledgeable about the project. Suggested sub-systems in meeting are  –

1.	Battery to power all the parts 
2.	Sensors to collect GPS locations 
3.	Micro-processor to run the code
4.	RF (Telemetry) module – for signal transmission

# Feb 4 : Telemetry Design – Antenna basics and frequency band
 
Went through a few links to understand basic features of antennas, frequency bands that antennas can use. There seem to be a lot of things to take into account while picking the exact antenna needed for our project. I asked for Ben’s input on how to make a selection, and he said that he had experience working with LoRa in the past, and would like me to research antennas that would work with it. Went through relevant antenna options for our use case.
Description of Long Range antennas (LoRa) and long range communication. Battery requirements details for these antennas.
