# Jan 17 : Submitted Idea – Elderly Fall Detection

I submitted my idea with some details on the Web Board. This idea is about detecting and notifying for elderly, consisting of a simple wearable device containing a range of LIDAR sensors, accelerometers etc. and integrate them with PCB and demonstrate data collection from sensors. Need some help from the TAs on how to approach building such a solution.
It seems to be better to prioritize looking for the right partners. Posted that I’m looking for groupmates on the web-board.
